        <p>Inspired by the need for a more robust and organized network infrastructure, I decided to build a custom network bay at home. This project aimed to create a reliable, high-performance network environment that supports all my devices efficiently and serves as a practical learning lab for network engineering.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Initiation</h2>
        <p>The first step was selecting the right hardware. I chose a TL-SG2424 switch for its reliable performance and ample ports for future expansion. An ER605v2 router was selected for its robust security features and advanced routing capabilities. For wireless connectivity, I implemented an Archer C5400 in AP mode, providing high-speed Wi-Fi across my home. Additionally, I integrated a Gigaset N300A for VoIP services using an SIP line from OVH. This combination of devices provided the foundation for a professional-grade network setup.</p>

                <h2>Flashing ER605v2 with OpenWRT</h2>
                <p>A significant challenge I undertook was flashing my TP-Link ER605v2 router with OpenWRT, an open-source Linux-based operating system. This process required careful execution to avoid bricking the device. Key steps included enabling SSH access, downloading a custom OpenWRT initramfs image, and using a script to write this image to the router's memory. After successfully flashing the initramfs, I completed the process by uploading a full OpenWRT sysupgrade image. This experience deepened my understanding of router firmware, bootloaders, and open-source network operating systems, while enhancing my skills in embedded systems and networking.</p>

        <h2>Learning and Outcomes</h2>
        <p>This project greatly enhanced my understanding of network topology, security, and management. I gained hands-on experience with network configuration, including setting up DHCP, DNS, and implementing network security protocols. The custom network bay now supports all my devices efficiently, providing a stable and high-performance network environment. Notably, the network's reliability and speed improved significantly, which is crucial for my daily activities and ongoing IT experiments.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 'Custom Network Bay' project was a fulfilling endeavor that expanded my skills in network engineering. It showcases how, with some planning and effort, one can create a professional-grade network setup at home, transforming it into a personal learning lab. This project not only improved my home network but also provided invaluable practical experience, reinforcing my knowledge and skills in IT and network management.</p>
