        <p>I wanted a more robust and organized network infrastructure so I decided to build a custom network bay at home. My goal was to to create a fast home-netwok that would support all my devices and serves as a practical learning lab.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Initiation</h2>
        <p>I started by comparing hardware to find the best "price to performance" ratio components. I chose a TL-SG2424 switch, an ER605v2 router, an Archer C5400 (used in AP mode) aswell as a Gigaset N300A for VoIP services using an SIP line from OVH. These were selected for their performance but also because they offer enterprise like protocols and configurations</p>

            <div class="text-next-to-image">
                <h2>Flashing ER605v2 with OpenWRT</h2>
                <p>A significant challenge I undertook was flashing my TP-Link ER605v2 router with OpenWRT. This process required careful execution to avoid bricking the device. Key steps included enabling SSH access, downloading a custom OpenWRT initramfs image, aswell as using a script to write this image to the router's memory. After successfully flashing the initramfs, I completed the process by uploading a full OpenWRT sysupgrade image. This experience deepened my understanding of router firmware, bootloaders, and open-source network operating systems.</p>

        <h2>Learning and Outcomes</h2>
        <p>I learned a lot about network topology, security, and management and I gained experience with network configuration and network security protocols. My network bay is now stable and it improved my network's reliability and speed significantly.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Making this project was a fulfilling endeavor that expanded my skills in network engineering. This not only improved my home network but also provided invaluable practical experience, reinforcing my knowledge and skills in IT and network management.</p>
