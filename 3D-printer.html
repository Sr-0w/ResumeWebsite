        <h2>Learning and Outcomes</h2>
        <p>This project not only improved my technical skills but also taught me about the intricacies of 3D printing technology. I can now create custom parts for various projects, from household items to unique gifts. The modified printer has proven to be a versatile tool in my home workshop.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Owning and running a 3D printer has been a rewarding experience. It has broadened my understanding of manufacturing and design, and continues to be a source of innovation and creativity. The Creality Ender 3 V2 Neo, especially with the Stealthburner modification, has become an indispensable part of my toolkit.</p>
