        <h2>Learning and Outcomes</h2>
        <p>This project significantly enhanced my understanding of electronics and programming. The custom smart lights can be controlled via a mobile app, thanks to the ESP32’s Wi-Fi capabilities. It has been a rewarding experience seeing the lights respond to my commands.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 'ESP32 Wiring and Programming' project was a successful endeavor that combined hardware and software skills. It demonstrated how powerful and versatile the ESP32 is for home automation projects. The custom smart lights are not only functional but also add a modern touch to my home.</p>
